# 1. What is Filtering in Image Processing?

At first we should what is filter means in image processing. Filtering is a technique for modifying or enhancing an image. 
For example, you can filter an image to emphasize certain features or remove other features. Image processing operations implemented with filtering include smoothing, sharpening, and edge enhancement.

# 2. What is the functionality of Gabor Filter?

Gabor filters are generally used in texture analysis, edge detection, feature extraction, disparity estimation (in stereo vision), etc. Gabor filters are special classes of bandpass filters, i.e., they allow a certain ‘band’ of frequencies and reject the others.


# 3.My purpose of learning Gabor Filter

I have determined texture orientation of each pixel by using Gabor Filter. Now we should know what do it means by texture Orientation.
It is nothing but gradient image. Now What is gradient of an Iamge?

An image gradient is a directional change in the intensity or color in an image. The gradient of the image is one of the fundamental building blocks in image processing. For example the Canny edge detector uses image gradient for edge detection.
